/* What will be the type of result in the following Java code?
   byte b =4;
   char c ='a';
   short s =512;
   int i = 1000;
   float f =3.14f;
   double d =99.0054;
   
   result = (f *b) + (i % c) - (d * s);*/


   //Solution:
  /* In the mentioned code, the result variable will
   be of double type because of type conversion.*/
